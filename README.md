## Express Sequelize REST project

POC for a simple MySQL > Sequelize > Express app that uses `sequelize-router` to auto-generate rest routes from model definitions.

You will need to pass the env var `ENV=DEVELOPMENT` or use a `.env` file. This project also uses `sequelize-cli` with the development config found in `config/config.json`.
